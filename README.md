# dryselcore
“Automate the (Test) Automation” - Built on the principle of "DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself", DrySelCore, automates the Selenium Script Generation by abstracting out repetitions in the UI test automation. That means your test developers write tests with an easy to follow declarative design pattern, without ever worrying about "Selenium".
